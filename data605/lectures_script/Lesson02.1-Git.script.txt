- Understanding how Linux works is crucial. It involves knowing about processes,
  file ownership, permissions, and virtual memory. Administering a Linux system
  as root is also a key skill.
- For beginners, there are resources like the "Command-Line for Beginners"
  tutorial. It covers basic commands such as `find`, `xargs`, `chmod`, `chown`,
  and explains symbolic and hard links.
- For those seeking mastery, "The Linux Command Line" is a comprehensive
  resource that delves deeper into Linux command-line usage.

Transition: Now, let's shift our focus to Git, an essential tool for version
control.

- The slides cover key Git concepts, which are fundamental for version control
  in projects.
- A tutorial is available to help you get started with Git, which will be used
  during the project.
- For advanced learning, "Pro Git" is a free resource that offers in-depth
  knowledge.
- There are several web resources to explore, such as githowto.com and
  dangitgit.com, which provide practical guidance.
- Interactive playgrounds like learngitbranching.js.org offer hands-on
  experience with Git commands and branching.

Transition: Understanding Git branching is crucial for effective version
control. Let's explore this concept further.

# Git Branching
# ##############################################################################

- Branching allows you to diverge from the main development line, enabling you
  to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
- The primary reason for branching is to work independently, avoid changes in
  the main branch, and merge updates downstream or upstream as needed.
- Git branching is lightweight and instantaneous, as branches are merely
  pointers to commits. Git stores data as snapshots, not file differences.
- In Git workflows, branching and merging occur frequently, often multiple times
  a day. This practice is efficient and helps isolate and organize work, making
  branches a valuable tool in version control.

- The master or main branch is the primary line of development in a Git
  repository. It acts as a pointer to the latest commit and advances with each
  new commit.
- The HEAD is a pointer that indicates the current branch you are working on,
  such as master or testing. Using the command git checkout <BRANCH>, you can
  switch between branches.
- The command git branch testing creates a new branch called testing. This new
  branch points to the current commit and can be moved as you make new commits.
- Divergent history occurs when work progresses on two separate branches,
  leading to different lines of development.

Let's move on to how we can switch between these branches using Git.

# ##############################################################################
# Git Checkout
# ##############################################################################

- The git checkout command is used to switch between branches. It moves the HEAD
  pointer to the new branch and updates the files in your working directory to
  match the branch you switched to.
- For example, if you have two branches, master and testing, and you are
  currently on master, using git checkout testing will move the pointer to the
  testing branch and change the working directory accordingly. You can continue
  working and committing on the testing branch, and the pointer will move
  forward with each commit.

Now, let's explore how branching and merging work together in Git.

# Git Branching and Merging
# ##############################################################################

- There are tutorials available for working on the main branch and handling hot
  fixes. These tutorials provide step-by-step guidance on managing branches in
  Git.
- You typically start with a project that already has some commits. From there,
  you can create a new branch to work on a specific feature or issue, such as
  "Issue 53."
- To create a new branch for a feature, you use the command git checkout -b
  iss53. You can then work on the feature, make changes, and commit them to the
  new branch. This allows you to develop features independently before merging
  them back into the main branch.

# Git Branching and Merging
# ##############################################################################

- When you need to apply a hotfix to the master branch, you start by checking
  out the master branch. This means you switch your working directory to the
  master branch to make changes directly related to it.
- Create a new branch called hotfix from the master branch. This allows you to
  make changes without affecting the master branch until you're ready.
- Make the necessary fixes in the hotfix branch. Once the changes are complete,
  commit them with a message like "Hot fix" to keep track of what was done.
- Switch back to the master branch to prepare for merging the hotfix changes.
- Merge the hotfix branch into the master branch. This incorporates the changes
  made in the hotfix branch into the master branch, ensuring the master branch
  is up-to-date with the latest fixes.
- Fast forward refers to a situation where there is a divergent history between
  the master branch and another branch, like iss53. This means changes have been
  made in both branches, and they need to be reconciled.

Now, let's explore how to handle divergent histories in Git.
